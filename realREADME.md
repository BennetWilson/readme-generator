# node.js README.md Generator
  ![Badge for GitHub repo top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/BennetWilson/readme-generator?style=flat&logo=appveyor) ![Badge for GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/BennetWilson/readme-generator?style=flat&logo=appveyor)
  

  
  
  ## Description 
  I was tasked with creating a README.md generator in node.js for this assignement. 

  This generator would take inputs from the user in the terminal and turn them into a README.md file.

  This generator uses Inquirer to handle the questions and inputs.

  This generator also has a table of contents that changes based on user inputs in the terminal. For example, if you respond to every prompt, every item will appear in the TOC.
  
  I also included a repository badge at the top to show the largest language percentage and the last commit to the repository.

  The generator allows for a choice of five license types, with the sixth option being 'none'. Whichever license type is chosen will populate with an icon in the generated README.md file.

  ## Installation
  
In the terminal in VsCode, type in 'npm init -y'. This will create a package.json. 

Next, type in 'npm install inquirer'. This will install the node module 'Inquirer' that the program uses to ask questions in the terminal.

  
  ## Usage 
Free to use. Anyone can use this to create README.md's faster and more efficiently.

README.md's made with this generator will be more consistent and will all include the option to have licenses and your repository badge on display.
